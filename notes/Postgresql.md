## full-text search
The behavior you're observing is **normal** and intentional in PostgreSQL's full-text search. Here's why some words like "of/is/as/the" are missing from your `search_vector`, and how the system works:

---

### **1. Stop Words Elimination**
PostgreSQL's full-text search automatically:
- **Removes "stop words"**: Common short words (articles, prepositions, conjunctions) that don't add search value (`the`, `of`, `is`, etc.)
- **Stems words**: Reduces words to their root form (`running` → `run`, `better` → `good`)

This is controlled by your text search configuration (`'english'` in your case).

---

### **2. View the Actual Tokenization**
To see exactly how PostgreSQL processes your text:

```sql
-- See how specific text gets tokenized
SELECT to_tsvector('english', 'This is the content of an article about programming');
```

**Result** will look like:
```
'about':6 'articl':5 'content':3 'program':7
```
Notice `this/is/the/of/an` are missing.

### **3. How to Preserve All Words (If Needed)**
If you **must** keep stop words (e.g., for legal/medical texts where every word matters):

#### Option A: Use `simple` configuration
```sql
ALTER TABLE article 
ALTER COLUMN search_vector SET GENERATED ALWAYS AS (
    to_tsvector('simple', coalesce(title, '')) || 
    to_tsvector('simple', coalesce(content, ''))
) STORED;
```
The `simple` configuration:
- Keeps all words
- Does no stemming
- Case-sensitive

#### Option B: Create a custom dictionary
1. Edit PostgreSQL's stop word file (advanced)
2. Or create a custom text search configuration:
```sql
CREATE TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION my_config (COPY = english);
ALTER TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION my_config DROP MAPPING FOR stopword;
```

---

### **4. Why This is Actually Good**
The default behavior:
- **Improves search quality**: Stop words add noise, not signal
- **Reduces index size**: By ~30-50%
- **Speeds up queries**: Fewer terms to compare

---

### **5. Testing Your Search**
Verify with queries that should match despite stop word removal:
```sql
-- Should still match "content of an article"
SELECT * FROM article 
WHERE search_vector @@ to_tsquery('english', 'content & article');
```

---

### **6. Key Takeaways**
| Behavior            | Why It Happens               | Should You Change It?        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Stop words removed  | Standard in full-text search | Only if absolutely necessary |
| Words stemmed       | "running" matches "run"      | Usually beneficial           |
| Punctuation ignored | "don't" becomes "dont"       | Expected behavior            |

For most applications, **the default behavior is ideal**. Only customize if you have specific needs like:
- Legal document search (where "Party A" vs "Party B" matters)
- Medical terminology preservation
- Exact phrase matching with stop words

Would you like me to show you how to implement one of the customization options?
